DDoS Guardian â€” Frontend (Traffic Pattern Based DDoS Detection)




ðŸš€ DDoS Guardian is a project aimed at detecting and preventing DDoS attacks using supervised learning.
ðŸ‘‰ Currently, only the frontend is complete and deployed on Vercel. The backend with ML models and APIs will be added in the next phase.

âœ¨ Features (Frontend)

Responsive UI built with React + Tailwind CSS

Pages for Traffic Pattern Visualization

Mock/Static data integration for demo purposes

Deployed and live on Vercel

ðŸ§± Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Vercel

Backend (Planned): Node/Express or Spring Boot (not yet implemented)

ML Models (Planned): Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree

ðŸ”— Live Demo

Frontend: https://ddos-gaurdian.vercel.app/
